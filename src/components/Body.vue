        <p >In my previous life, I was Dreadloc-head Yogi. I loved to lift weights and bake cakes. My favourite pastime was running my hands through my furry Gigi’s hair and growing vegetables in my little garden.</p>
        <p class="pt-4"> In this life, I am a Shopify developer who loves to be a part of people's growth journeys. To me, E-commerce is not only about selling. It is about adding value to other people. I love helping small businesses portray their unique value through their online store. My biggest reward is knowing that I am a part of achieving this goal.</p>
